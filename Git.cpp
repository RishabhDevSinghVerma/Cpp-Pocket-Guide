◙  𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐂++

C++ is a high-level programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. 
First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language.We make fast program using c++.
We have more control over system resources and memory management.C++ language is a superset of C language.

  C++ Join three seprate programming traditions:-
  - the procedural language tradition,represented by C;
  - the Object Oriented language tradition ,represented by the class enhancements C++ adds to C;
  - Generic programming,supported by C++ templates

◙  𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞: A procedural language is a sort of computer programming language that has a set of functions, instructions and 
                                  statements that must be executed in a certain order to accomplish a job or program. 

                                                                          OR 

Procedural Programming Language as per name mean emphasis procedurure. Procedure means step by step tasks which we want to perform.
In high level language this procedure called Function .Function is group of task which perform particular task.In this type of language we divide functions into smaller parts.

1)Its emphasis on algorithm(doing task) rather than data.
2)Large programs are divide into samaller parts called functions.
3)Its follows Top down approachs.Ex-C,Fortan,Cobol etc.

The basic task of a top-down approach is to divide the problem into tasks and then divide tasks into smaller sub-tasks and so on. In this approach, first we develop the main module and then the next level modules are developed. This procedure is continued until all the modules are developed.
